## About the Project 🌟

Perspective Matters is a groundbreaking Flutter application that revolutionizes the way we engage with differing viewpoints. By leveraging the power of Google's Gemini AI, this app creates an intelligent debate platform where two AI agents engage in structured discourse, challenging our preconceptions and broadening our understanding of complex topics.

## 🌟 Social Impact at the Core

In a world increasingly fragmented by polarization, Perspective Matters emerges as a powerful tool for social healing and understanding.
An App where Two AI Agents debate against each other on any valid topic providing a wider perspective about the topic to the general public.
